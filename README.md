## **How the Project Came About**

This repository is part of my Python learning journey, where I am working through projects that enhance my skills and knowledge in various areas of Python development. These projects are sourced from the Python Roadmap ([Roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/python/projects)) and include challenges from beginner to advanced levels.

## **Motivation Behind It**

I created this repository as a way to document and showcase the projects I complete as I continue learning Python. Through these projects, I aim to build a solid understanding of Python and its capabilities. This also provides an opportunity for me to share my learning with others.
